Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to

* explain commonly used acronyms in the field
* identify suitable terminology for specific audiences


Nomenclature
------------

You may see:

* CAS - Computer Assisted Surgery
* CAI - Computer Assisted Interventions
* IGS - Image-Guided Surgery
* IGT - Image-Guided Therapy
* IGI - Image-Guided Interventions

`Ziv Yaniv`_ has a few more!


Communities
-----------

The field of "Computer Assisted Surgery and Therapy", which is the title of this
module, brings together clinical and technical communities.

Surgeons
^^^^^^^^

Surgery can be defined as
`a procedure involving cutting, or joining together a person's tissues`_
for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment (Wikipedia).
Surgeons do surgery in an operating room or operating theatre.
Most operating theatres do not have large imaging devices in.
Some operating theatres may have a C-arm X-ray machine. Portable
imaging devices such as endoscopy or laparoscopy stacks or ultrasound machines
are brought in as necessary.


Interventional Radiologists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Interventional Radiologists, or Vascular and Interventional Radiologists perform
their procedures in an Interventional Radiology Suite, or Vascular Suite, that is
equiped with built-in large imaging devices, like a Siemens Zeego.

The :ref:`bookMauro` book, comes from the perspective of Interventional Radiology.
Interventional Radiologists have been using image-guidance for decades to perform
a wide variety of `interventional procedures`_. These suite's typically
have X-ray flouroscopy, Cone Beam CT etc.

Interventional Radiologists routinely do image-guided procedures, and
they would call them "Image-Guided Interventions". However, engineers in
the field of CAS/CAI may not call them "Computer Assisted Surgery"
or "Computer Assisted Interventions", as there is no additional computer.


Surgery + Imaging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recently, combined surgical and imaging/interventional radiology suite's
have been developed. The most notable of which, at the time of writing,
is the Siemens AMIGO suite.

at the Ferenc Jolesz National Centre for Image-Guided Therapy.
Ferenc Jolesz is also the author of :ref:`bookJolesz`.

Summary
------------

Therefore, we define:

* Surgery - `a procedure involving cutting, or joining together a person's tissues`_ (Wikipedia).
* Therapy - treating a medical condition, e.g. radio-frequency ablation
* Interventions - broader term, encapsulating both surgical procedures and therapies
* Computer Assisted - using an additional computational system, above and beyond that provided by the manufacturer of an imaging device

hence MPHY0026: "Computer Assisted Surgery and Therapy".


Caveats
-------

* Prototype CAS systems may eventually become embeded in clinical practice and indistinguishable from imaging devices.
