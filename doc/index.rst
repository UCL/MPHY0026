Course Principles
-----------------

* *Research led*: Closely linked to academic literature, and research at UCL and world-wide.
* *A systems approach*: A researcher may only work on one component, but to achieve the clinical goal, we must understand the total system performance.
* *Learn by doing*: Code examples, often using the `SciKit-Surgery`_ libraries, referenced in `The SciKit-Surgery Paper`_, and described in this `IPCAI 2020 presentation`_.
