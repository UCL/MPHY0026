Authors: Matt Clarkson, Steve Thompson, Ester Bonmati

This is the git repository of the Computer Assisted Surgery and Therapy (MPHY0026) course
developed at the `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences`_,
part of `University College London (UCL)`_.

The generated documentation lives on `Read The Docs`_.


Running
-------

For examples demonstrated in class, you must be "inside" the environment created
by tox. Please work through the whole of the `SNAPPY Tutorial`_ to understand
more about Python development, tox and virtualenvs. For those in a hurry,
you can do this to run examples:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/MPHY0026
# Get inside the repository directory
cd MPHY0026
# Install tox if it is not already installed
pip install tox
# Run tox commands without any arguments.(The command may take up to 10 minutes)
tox
# For Mac and Linux users, run the command
source .tox/py36/bin/activate
# For Windows users, run the the commands
cd .tox\py36\bin
activate
# The environment is setup now and you can run any example with the application.
```

Developing
----------

Cloning
^^^^^^^

You can clone the repository using the following command:

::

    git clone https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/MPHY0026


Running tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pytest is used for running unit tests, but you should run using tox,
as per the `Python Template`_ instructions and described in the `SNAPPY Tutorial`_.


Linting
^^^^^^^

This code conforms to the PEP8 standard. Pylint is used to analyse the code.
Again, follow the `SNAPPY Tutorial`_ instructions and run via tox.
